# User API (FastAPI Example)

A simple in‑memory User API built with FastAPI.  
It demonstrates:

- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Delete) for users
- Request validation with Pydantic v2
- Custom middleware that adds a response header
- Automatic interactive API docs (Swagger UI & ReDoc)

API Usage
Below are example requests for each endpoint.

Home Route (GET /)
Description:
Returns a simple welcome message to confirm that the API is running.

Create User (POST /users)
Endpoint:

Request body example:

Behavior:

Validates the request using Pydantic.
Name must be a string.
Age must be a number (e.g., an integer).
Get All Users (GET /users)
Endpoint:

With optional limit parameter:

Behavior:

Returns a list of all users currently stored in memory.
If limit is provided, returns only that number of users (e.g., first 2 users).
Get User by ID (GET /users/{user_id})
Endpoint:

Example:

Behavior:

Returns the user with the given user_id.
Typically returns a 404-style response if the user is not found (depending on your implementation).
Delete User (DELETE /users/{user_id})
Endpoint:

Example:

Behavior:

Deletes the user with the given user_id from the in-memory list.
Typically returns a confirmation message or status.
Middleware
This project includes a simple middleware that:

Adds a custom header to each response, for example:
X-App-Name: User API
This shows how to use middleware in FastAPI to modify requests or responses globally.

Pydantic Validation
User data is validated using Pydantic models, for example:

name: string
age: integer (or number)
If invalid data is sent, FastAPI will automatically return a clear validation error response.

Documentation
FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation:

Swagger UI:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
ReDoc:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

Notes
Users are stored in memory (all data is lost when the server restarts).
No database is used in this simple project.
This project is meant for learning FastAPI basics, including:
Routing
Request/response models
Middleware
Validation
